<h2>Motive</h2>

<p>
Often times developers have to set up webhooks to integrate with certain web service providers.
<br><br>Examples:<br><br>
facebook messenger webhooks - for chat bots<br>
twitter feeds webhooks - for sentiment analysis<br> 
braintree webhooks - for payment subscription updates<br>
</p>

Using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is usually the preferred way by developers,
but roger is a better way based on AWS services listed bellow.

1. AWS API Gateway
2. AWS Lambda
3. AWS SQS

Amount you will have to pay is much lesser than the tunnel based solutions.
Its production ready, design for high availability and scalability.
